 TODO: On this page, there should be a number of different sections relating to each individual algorithm.
        Overview
        Big O (time complexity).  - Ontop of this, maybe a small 'What is Big O Notation' page - graph https://i.stack.imgur.com/ia6VB.png?
        Stability (y/n)
        Step by step example of the sort. (Maybe with a small visualised array in 5 boxes)
        May be difficult to add, but the big O graph, with all other lines slightly greyed out - and the relevant one shown

        MAYBE: space complexity

        The algorithm will only recognise that the list is in order if it makes no changes in a pass.
